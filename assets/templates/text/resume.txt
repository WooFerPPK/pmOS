<h3>Projects</h3>
<hr></hr>
<h4>Reseller Control Panel</h4>
<p>Reseller Control Panel was aimed at consolidating all the services offered by OpenSRS and allowing resellers to manage their domains. I was responsible for developing the frontend of the application using the CanJS framework. By working closely with the backend team, I ensured the successful integration of the application with OpenSRS services.
